# CHEK1 dependency map
Create a cancer dependency map with CHEK1 as the hub. Checkpoint kinases (Chks) encoded as CHEK1 has a central role in coordinating the DNA damage response and therefore is an area of great interest in oncology and the development of cancer therapeutics. We found the pathway of CHEK1 along with TIMELESS, RRM1, WEE1, RRM2, POLE genes, which could potentially be a target new drug.
